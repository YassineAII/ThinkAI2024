# ThinkAI 2024

Welcome to the official repository for the second edition of the ThinkAI Hackathon, organized by Math&Maroc and 1337AI! This repository showcases the remarkable works of the talented participants who took part in this exciting event.

The second edition of ThinkAI, a premier AI Hackathon, took place from May 16th to May 19th 2024 at the 1337 Coding School in Benguerir, Morocco. This event brought together students from various Moroccan schools to exhibit their creativity and expertise in the field of Artificial Intelligence. It provided a platform for participants to address real-world problems using AI technologies and explore the potential of AI in different domains.

Throughout the hackathon, participants formed teams and worked on projects related to Generative AI, reflecting this year's theme: Generative AI in service of Moroccans. The event spanned four days of intense competition, innovation, and collaboration among bright Moroccan minds. As a testament to their hard work and achievements, many trophies were awarded, and the accumulated prizes for the top three winners amounted to 10,000 DH (approximately 1,000 euros).
